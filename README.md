# AirUp
An Startup based investment support company.
In this deep thought process of the world, we don’t know what thought/idea we may get at the moment. Who knows the picture may be a competition next to the international e-commerce application Amazon or a competition to Tesla. Even when we innovate something we should need investment like water to a growing tree. We in a sense the young minds of entrepreneurs are finding it tough for investor support or expert support. For that problem, numerous intelligent ideas are going to vein without no reason. I felt very bad about it, then our team started surfing this problem on the internet such that if we find an efficient website on this basis. There is a saying that “The entrepreneur starts with daily life”. We didn’t find any dedicated platform on it. Then our exciting and interesting journey starts….  

Proposed Solution:

Introducing “AIR UP” which is extracted from startup + AIR (which means online) when combined gives air up. where it acts as an interface between the entrepreneur and the investor. We have given dedicated research for about 3 months on this aspect. After that, we found all our website is unique.  
This is a software-based web application that has two sections in it further divided into many subparts.  
First, we discuss the top two layers:  
1. Ideate Section  
2. Invest Section   
In the Ideate section the young minds of the world will create and submit their own ideas/innovations which are displayed for investors for the ease of investment.  
In the Investment section, the investors will able to visit the ideas from all over the world which are displayed on websites which are submitted by entrepreneurs. (For Idea security purposes we are using a patent system on various levels)  
This is the basic idea of our startup. From this, we enhanced our ideas and deployed a few decent features which will be explained later.

Predicting whether the investor will get profit or loss using machine learning:  

The profit or loss for an investor can be predicted by the capital expenditure of the company versus how much profit/loss they have incurred previously, the profit/loss of the company can be estimated in the following manner – if an investor invents some amount in the company it will help to increase the capital expenditure of the company and profit is dependent on the capital expenditure so this can be used to predict the profit of loss of a company and the company’s previous profit/loss, previous investments generation data will be taken into consideration.  
The investor's profit is also dependent on the valuation of the company and it will be analyzed how the company’s valuation is changing with time and how ill will change in the future. An investor’s new investment will also increase the valuation of the company so, by considering these factors the future valuation of the company is predicted using which it can be predicted whether the investor will get a profit or not.  
The profit for the investor can be obtained by applying multilinear regression or polynomial regression depending on the data which can be understood by visualizing it. The factors discussed above can be used as input features and profit will be predicted. Firstly, the company's financial data is collected and the data is cleaned, scaled, and transformed now the data is visualized which helps us in getting a clear understanding of the data. Then the regression model is built using scikit learn library in Python using which the model is prepared then the test data is passed on to the model to find the accuracy then the model is used to predict the profits.  

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MYSQL, ML
